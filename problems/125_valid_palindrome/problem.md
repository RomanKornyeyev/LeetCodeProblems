# 125. Valid Palindrome (easy 🟢)
[Problem in LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/description/)<br>
A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers. 

Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.
```

Example 3:
```
Input: s = " "
Output: true
Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.
```
